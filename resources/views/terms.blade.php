    <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

    <p>These Terms and Conditions (further referred to as “Terms”) determine the use of the online application
        LARAVEL.IO. The online application consists of the original website, any related websites and the software used
        to provide the application.</p>

    <p>This use of the application includes; The use of the LARAVEL.IO application by a subscriber. The restricted use
        of the LARAVEL.IO application by third parties authorised by a subscriber with regards to certain aspects of
        the application. The use of LARAVEL.IO add-ons such as the available widgets. These Terms are to be considered
        as the legal backbone of the application. Every referral to these Terms, however, is considered to include the
        additional policies that accompany the former such as the Privacy Policy. If any differences exist between the
        terms and the specific agreements, the latter prevails unless stated otherwise. We advise and expect our
        subscribers to take careful notice of these legal documents and all additional information that may accompany.
        The registration and use of the application, including the mere visiting of the website, implies that Subscriber
        and authorised user took notice and agrees with these Terms. This creates a contractual relationship between
        LARAVEL.IO and the Subscriber. Our obligations under this agreement must always be judged with regard to the
        characteristics of the account.</p>

    <h4>WHAT DOES LARAVEL.IO OFFER?</h4>

    <p>LARAVEL.IO aims to offer a place for the Subscriber where they can find answers to tech related questions and
        find more info about Laravel and related technologies in general. It offers a variety of tools for the
        Subscriber to interact and keep up to date with their peers.</p>

    <h4>REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT</h4>

    <p>The convincing starts with the registration of an account. We may offer test accounts so that you can be sure
        that our application provides an added value to your organization. LARAVEL.IO is free to determine the
        allocation and the extent of this test account and may withdraw or modify at any time this test account.</p>

    <p>If you register for an account you agree to the following principles: You have provided accurate, current and
        complete information as has been demanded during the registration-process. We encourage you to keep this
        information up-to-date according to those principles. You must ensure the confidentiality of your account,
        including the confidentiality of your login-data such as the password. Every breach of confidentiality should
        be notified as soon as possible to the website-administrator. It is strictly forbidden to ask for the login-data
        of other subscribers and/or login onto one other’s account. It is strictly forbidden to propose on the
        application in a fraudulent manner. For example the use of a false account and/or providing false information
        is considered as fraudulent use. Proposing yourself as another (legal or natural) person on the application
        without the necessary permission may lead to civil and criminal sanctions. Subscriber is always the sole
        responsible for every use and activity of his account. Subscriber may create additional accounts for employees,
        contributors and co-operators. Subscriber determines the extent of the rights of these additional accounts and
        subscriber will always remain responsible for every use of these additional accounts. Needless to say that these
        additional accounts are governed by these terms. LARAVEL.IO does manage new registrations but not in a
        pro-active manner. This implies that we will only act upon notifications of a controversial registration.
        A well-reasoned and founded notification may lead to the temporary and/or perpetual suspension and/or removal
        of the Subscriber. We preserve ourselves a wide margin of discretion to ensure best quality of our services.
        The registration of an account is not assimilated with the acquisition of ownership or other proprietary
        interests to that account. All rights in and to the account are and shall forever be owned by and inure to the
        benefit of LARAVEL.IO.</p>

    <h4>CHARACTERISTICS OF LARAVEL.IO</h4>

    <p>A high level of availability. We want you to experience LARAVEL.IO as trustworthy so we took every reasonable and
        necessary measure to guarantee a high level of availability. We cannot, however, guarantee the all-time
        availability, but we commit ourselves to resolve interruptions, repairs and failures within a very short term.
        This is an obligation of means.</p>

    <p>LARAVEL.IO is not responsible for the lack of access that is due to improper behaviour of the Subscriber. It is
        the sole responsibility of the Subscriber to take the necessary measures that enable the access to our
        application. LARAVEL.IO is only fully functional and effective if the Subscriber has the necessary
        pre-specified hardware (browser) software and telecommunication facilities available. The equipment and
        software used must meet the system requirements as clearly communicated by LARAVEL.IO.</p>

    <h4>GOOD PERFORMANCE AND SAFE NATURE OF THE APPLICATION</h4>

    <p>LARAVEL.IO is responsible for the proper operation and safe nature of its application. All reasonable and
        necessary technical, non-technical, organisational and juridical measures are provided by LARAVEL.IO in order
        to answer these requirements.</p>

    <p>We took for example all reasonable measures to protect the content of subscriber against accidental or unlawful
        destruction or accidental loss, modification, unauthorized disclosure and access. LARAVEL.IO will create on a
        regular basis a backup of the data stored in the application, and determines freely the frequency of the backup.
        It remains the responsibility of the Subscriber to always provide an own backup of the content he has provided.
        We exclude our liability with regard to the costs of reproduction of mutilated or lost data.</p>

    <p>As we depend on the use of Internet, LARAVEL.IO is not able to guarantee that its services are absolutely
        reliable and safe. Above mentioned obligations are an obligation of means. The Subscriber acknowledges and
        agrees that LARAVEL.IO can and will never be fully free of imperfections and that not all imperfections can be
        (re)covered. It is within the responsibility of the subscriber to protect his equipment, software,
        telecommunications- and Internet-connection against viruses, computer crime and illegal use by third
        parties.</p>

    <h4>REGULAR MAINTENANCE, UPDATES AND SUPPORT</h4>

    <p>We wish to keep the quality of our application high by performing maintenance activities and updates of the
        application on a regular basis. We may therefore limit at any time the access or use of LARAVEL.IO to the
        extent necessary for maintenance or to perform modifications or enhancements to the application. The above
        gives no grounds for compensation on behalf of LARAVEL.IO.</p>

    <p>LARAVEL.IO provides the necessary support to the subscribers. We strive to provide clear and conclusive answers
        to any relevant question or comment so as to contribute to the solution of the problem. Questions and comments
        should always be made in writing via the email dries.vints@gmail.com.</p>

    <h4>PRIVACY AND DATA</h4>

    <p>Every subscriber of LARAVEL.IO reveals some information on himself. This amount of information varies as more
        operations are performed, for example after registration. Depending on the quality of the information, it is
        possible that an individual can be identified. At that time we are collecting personal data. As we attach great
        value to privacy and the protection of personal privacy, we have taken the effort to inquire you on the
        processing of personal data in the most comprehensive manner. We kindly refer you to our
        <a href="{{ route('privacy') }}">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <p>We also expect that our Subscribers value these principles in high standard. Subscribers can and will use
        LARAVEL.IO to process personal information on their own contacts. Subscriber will be the data controller and
        LARAVEL.IO will be a mere processor. It is the sole responsibility of the subscriber to process this
        information in accordance with applicable privacy legislations!</p>

    <h4>ACCEPTABLE USE</h4>

    <p>We would like to provide a safe and sound application but we need your help to succeed in our mission. You can
        help us out by just behaving in a sentiment of good faith. We do require you to refrain from any action that
        may jeopardise LARAVEL.IO. This includes but is not limited to the following actions; Subscribers should not
        disturb the good operation of the website. This includes that subscribers should refrain from the use of
        viruses, worms, Trojans or other software that may infringe the services and interests of both LARAVEL.IO and
        its subscribers. Subscribers should also refrain from any content that may burden or disturb the websites
        infrastructure and its proper functioning. Subscribers should not send unsolicited and/or commercial messages
        between members, such as junk mail, spamming and chain letters. Nor should subscribers send threatening
        messages and other disturbing messages between subscribers. Subscribers should refrain from adding content that
        can be described as not-appropriate regarding the aims of the platform. LARAVEL.IO reserves a large discretion
        and may notify subscribers when touching boundaries. Subscribers should refrain from practices that may
        circumvent the business-model of LARAVEL.IO. Subscribers should not violate our rules regarding content. This
        list tries to be complete but is far from exhaustive. The facilitation and encouragement of such violations is
        also a violation. LARAVEL.IO preserves itself a large margin of discretion when considering behaviour of
        subscribers. Any subscriber-action that can be considered as not ‘in good faith’ is presumed to fall within
        this margin of discretion. Non-compliance may also lead to the Subscriber’s liability. LARAVEL.IO will help as
        much as possible any wronged party, for example by providing the necessary contact details.</p>

    <h4>CONTENT MANAGEMENT</h4>

    <p>Our application is only useful when the subscriber starts adding content to LARAVEL.IO. We consider content in
        its broadest definition, containing inter alia text, graphics, logo’s, designs, sound files etc.
        Subscribers may use our offered tools for the integration of content that can be extracted from other online
        platforms such as social media. The subscriber acknowledges and agrees that LARAVEL.IO may extract and use this
        content when Subscriber uses these tools. We guarantee you that we only extract content that is necessary and
        useful for the application. Subscriber is always the sole responsible with regard to the content he may add to
        his account, including the extracted content. There is however one clear boundary to the added content: the
        content should be appropriate with regards to the aim and intentions of LARAVEL.IO. This is a broad definition
        but will not pose a problem for a Subscriber in good faith. We have a wide discretion when assessing the
        content. With regards to certain topics we would like to be clear in advance that we do not accept such
        content: Your content should not refer to or be the result of unlawful, misleading, malicious, or
        discriminatory activities. Your content should not violate any applicable or existing laws or the rights of
        third parties. This includes violations of Privacy laws, Intellectual Property rights etc. Your content should
        not be of hateful, threatening or pornographic character. You should refrain from linking to (child-)
        pornographic material or any other material that is contrary to public order and morality. This prohibition
        also includes bullying, intimidation, harassment or defamation of any individual. Your content should not
        consist of unsolicited promotions, political campaigning, advertising and solicitations. You should refrain
        from inappropriate, (sexually) intimidating, vulgar or hateful speech on the platform, link such speech to the
        platform or make a link to such speech on the platform. SUBSCRIBERs should refrain from any content that
        promotes or is the consequence of illegal activities. Above-mentioned list has an indicative value but is far
        from exhaustive. LARAVEL.IO does not perform any prior supervision on new content that is added to the
        application. The publication of content does not imply an automatic approval of the content by LARAVEL.IO. We
        do take the necessary action towards inappropriate content upon the receiving of a well-reasoned and founded
        claim. These claims can be directed at dries.vints@gmail.com. It is possible that some of the content on our
        application can be downloaded. Every download from our website is at own risk and damages resulting from loss
        of data or damage to the computer system is entirely and solely the responsibility of the Subscriber. This at
        own-risk also applies to the links LARAVEL.IO contains many links to other websites and / or electronic
        communication portals that are not under the effective control of LARAVEL.IO. Making such a reference does not
        mean that we (implicitly) agree with the content of those websites. The visit of theseThese references are
        therefore to click at your own risk and responsibility, and to be visited by the Subscriber. LARAVEL.IO is not
        liable for any damage resulting therefrom.</p>

    <h4>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h4>

    <p>We consider Intellectual Property and their derived rights as very important as it is all about a proper reward
        for those who made the effort. As much as we care to protect our own achievements, we want to protect yours as
        well. Whenever you are confronted with a possible violation of your rights on LARAVEL.IO we gladly perform the
        necessary actions to make an end to these violations.</p>

    <p>Do you take notice of a violation of your rights? We gladly act upon the receiving of a well-reasoned and valid
        notification. This may result in the removal of the concerned content and/or a limited access to the content.
        Please contact us at dries.vints@gmail.com. If, however, you feel your content has been removed without reason
        or valid ground, feel free to contact us so we can work on a solution.</p>

    <h4>THE LARAVEL.IO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h4>

    <p>The application LARAVEL.IO is protected by Intellectual Property Rights with regards to the content, software,
        source code, database and suchlike. These rights are the property of LARAVEL.IO and/or its licensors and remain
        the property of their respective owners. The use of the website does not imply a transfer of the Intellectual
        Property Rights towards the subscriber. Every subscriber should be aware at all time of these Intellectual
        Property Rights and should therefor refrain from any violations as they may lead to his liability.</p>

    <p>LARAVEL.IO wishes to create an environment that is safe for the subscriber regarding to Intellectual Property.
        LARAVEL.IO therefore grants its Subscribers a limited, temporary, revocable and non- exclusive license to use
        the application as provided by LARAVEL.IO, in the manner permitted by these terms. This license may not be
        subject of any transfer or (sub-) licensing. This license also includes the possibility to create a link to
        certain URL of the LARAVEL.IO-website, in so far as this is considered as ‘fair use’ of this license. Such a
        link cannot derogate the independent, intermediary position of LARAVEL.IO. LARAVEL.IO can undertake every
        possible action in order to remove the wrongful use of a link.</p>

    <p>Every other action than the above mentioned requires the explicit, written consent of LARAVEL.IO. Upon such
        consent, these actions are not permitted.</p>

    <h4>THE SUBSCRIBER’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h4>

    <p>Every subscriber that makes active use of the application provides quite a lot of content to the application,
        in all kinds of forms such as text, graphics, logo’s, designs, sound files etc. This content is the
        intellectual property of Subscriber or its respective owner. By providing the content to the application as a
        subscriber, you certify that you have the necessary rights for this purpose.</p>

    <p>As soon as Subscriber adds content on the platform, he grants LARAVEL.IO a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive,
        transferable, sub-licensable, and free of charge license to use, display, reproduce, duplicate, modify, adapt,
        translate and create derivative works from the content. This license regards to all types of Intellectual
        Property, within the boundaries of applicable law. LARAVEL.IO engages to only use this content for the purposes
        of functioning and operation of the application and the own services. Subscriber grants towards other
        LARAVEL.IO-Subscribers a worldwide, perpetual, non- exclusive, free of charge license to use, display,
        reproduce, duplicate, modify, adapt, translate and create derivative works from the content in so far this is
        necessary for their bona fide use of LARAVEL.IO.</p>

    <p>LARAVEL.IO is not responsible if the provided content is an infringement on the Intellectual Property rights of
        other Subscribers or third parties. We do take the necessary action towards violating content upon the
        receiving of a well-reasoned and founded claim. These claims can be directed at dries.vints@gmail.com.
        LARAVEL.IO cannot be held responsible for Intellectual Property violations nor for any direct or indirect
        damage due to such violations.</p>

    <h4>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>

    <p>LARAVEL.IO performs the role of a mere intermediary platform and can only be held liable for its obligations
        regarding this role. LARAVEL.IO is only liable for any major or repeated minor contractual and/or
        non-contractual breach, including any obligation of warranty, caused in the performance of his obligations
        under this Agreement that may be attributed to LARAVEL.IO. LARAVEL.IO’s liability is restricted to direct
        damages up to the amount that subscriber paid in the 6 months prior to the breach of obligation. The absolute
        maximum amount LARAVEL.IO can be held accountable for is € 500. LARAVEL.IO is not liable for indirect damages
        such as consequential damages, lost profits, financial or commercial loss, loss of clientele, loss of
        reputation, loss resulting from claims of customers of the subscriber, etc. This list of examples of indirect
        damages tries to be complete but is far from exhaustive.</p>

    <p>Although we are improving our technology every day, LARAVEL.IO cannot provide absolute guarantees with regard to
        its safety and availability. Every use of LARAVEL.IO remains always at own risk. In every case, LARAVEL.IO is
        not liable for: Any damages inflicted by force majeure. Force majeure is every extra-ordinary event or
        circumstance beyond the control of the parties that prevents LARAVEL.IO from fulfilling its obligations.
        This includes the situation where LARAVEL.IO is not able to perform due to its own suppliers. LARAVEL.IO is
        not liable for damages due to other causes that are foreign to LARAVEL.IO, such as actions or omissions of
        third parties that are characterised by a particular ingenuity. This includes every use of third parties that
        can be qualified as wrongful conduct and misconducts of the website, but is not excluded to such situations.</p>

    <p>LARAVEL.IO is not responsible for shortcomings to specific legal obligations by subscribers and is not
        responsible for infringements to these Terms. Every subscriber that performs an action or omission that may
        affect the liability of LARAVEL.IO is held to safeguard LARAVEL.IO and its employees, managers and directors
        from any claims and damages that may arise. This includes damages that LARAVEL.IO may suffer such as loss of
        income, loss of reputation, etc. The subscriber is held to safeguard LARAVEL.IO from any judicial procedures
        relating to this.</p>

    <p>The liability of LARAVEL.IO should be regarded in accordance with the valid legal interpretations. This should
        anyway be in the interpretation that leans the most towards this General Subscriber Agreement.</p>

    <h4>DURATION AND TERMINATION</h4>

    <p>These conditions remain valid until termination by LARAVEL.IO or Subscriber. The termination of the agreement
        implies that the Subscriber no longer has access to his account on LARAVEL.IO. Subscriber acknowledges and
        accepted that the termination does not give rise to any liability on the part of LARAVEL.IO nor lead to a
        refund of the paid fees. Termination shall be without prejudice to the payment of any due amounts.</p>

    <p>We preserve the right to deactivate your account when we notice inactivity for more than two (2) months.
        The deactivation is interrupted during the premium account. The deactivation of a Subscriber does not
        automatically imply that the account and the relevant content are immediately and irrevocably removed.
        LARAVEL.IO undertakes the promise not to remove this content for at least two (2) months following the
        deactivation.</p>

    <p>LARAVEL.IO has the right to sanction violations to this agreement, and by extension any behaviour of a
        Subscriber that is contrary to the good faith. We preserve ourselves a wide margin of discretion, both
        with regard to the violating behaviour as with regard to the appropriate sanction. In order to provide you
        with some idea on the sanctioning, following sanctions are regarded as most common; Temporary or perpetual
        suspension, modification or deletion of the account; Temporary or perpetual deletion of content;
        Inaccessibility of certain content for the public; Sanctioning does not require any or comprehensive reasoning
        and can be done without prior notification. There’s no time limit between the defective behaviour and the
        sanction. We can take the necessary technical measures to avoid circumvention of sanctions. If you feel you
        have been unjustifiably sanctioned, feel free to contact us so we can resolve these misunderstandings.</p>

    <h4>FUTURE CHANGES</h4>

    <p>LARAVEL.IO is still looking for new opportunities. That’s why our services are always evolving and we may at
        all times change the form and nature of our services. As a Subscriber you agree that we may create a limit on
        use and storage at our sole discretion at all time. We may even decide to end LARAVEL.IO and its services
        (permanently or temporarily) at all times. LARAVEL.IO may transfer its obligations onto a third
        party. LARAVEL.IO preserves the right to unilaterally change these terms at all time. Every unilateral change
        will be communicated on a clear and efficient manner towards the Subscribers and will be applied at renewal of
        each license period, at latest three months after the communication. Subscribers have a positive obligation to
        take notice on a regular basis of the terms and conditions, especially in the case of a new change. There is
        no possibility to continue the use of LARAVEL.IO under the old conditions if you do not agree with any
        substantial or essential changes. Subscriber is in that case free to cancel your account with us without
        further ado. Subscriber may apply for a pro rata refund of the paid fee.</p>

    <p>No other deviations regarding the Terms and the Privacy Policy are considered to exist without an explicit
        agreed and written proof. No other general conditions of the Subscribers are considered applicable. The
        (sub) titles of these documents have a mere indicative value and do not grant specific rights to the
        Subscribers. The mere invalidity or inapplicability of one or more single clauses does not affect the
        validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. LARAVEL.IO has the right of first initiative to
        change the invalid or inapplicable clauses unilaterally.</p>

    <h4>FINAL PROVISIONS</h4>

    <p>This agreement is exclusively governed by Belgian legislation. Barring the rules of Brussels I- regulation
        and other applicable law, the courts of Antwerp (Belgium) are presumed competent. Parties agree to a cooling
        off period of sixty (60) days in which they try to solve their dispute informally before initiating any court
        proceeding. The cooling off period commences upon the receiving of a written notification.</p>

    <p>LARAVEL.IO is an active supranational actor, which implies that other jurisdictions may rule on the clauses of
        this agreement and a different interpretation may be applied. LARAVEL.IO wishes to ensure that in such case
        these agreements should be interpreted strict within the legal margin of interpretation.</p>
